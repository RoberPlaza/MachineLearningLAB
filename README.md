# Machine Learning Techniques
Repository about Sherlock and Moriarty's problem for the subject Machine Learning Techniques.

## Problem
Sherlock and Moriarty is an iranian problem whose purpose is to learn, prepare and protect about several types of cyber-hazards. This database contains information gathered from several smartphones, and the goal is to make a program that could detect how many of those terminals were infected by the virus of Moriarty.

## Milestones
In **Milestone 1** we carry out a complete Exploratory Data Analysis process of a subset of this dataset.

* [Milestone 1](https://github.com/RoberPlaza/MachineLearningLAB/tree/master/milestone1)

In **Milestone 2**  we have to predict when Moriarty will attack the device with Sherock in order to build a model.
* [Milestone 2](https://github.com/RoberPlaza/MachineLearningLAB/tree/master/milestone2)

In **Milestone 3**  we will finalize the model developed in the previous milestone and draw the relevant conclusions..

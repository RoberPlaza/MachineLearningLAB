## 1. Dataset description
The description of the dataset and the features are the same as in milestone 2, we will use data from T2.csv.

## Decision tree
  * [6_decision_tree.py](https://github.com/RoberPlaza/MachineLearningLAB/blob/development/milestone3/6_decision_tree.py)

After several attempts to parameterize, we do not know why spyder did not leave us and we
